/*
You are given an array arr[], you have to re-construct 
an array arr[].
The values in arr[] are obtained by doing Xor of 
consecutive elements in the array

At index 0, arr[0] xor arr[1] = 1
At index 1, arr[1] xor arr[2] = 10
At index 2, arr[2] xor arr[3] = 3
...
At index 4, No element is left So, it will remain as
it is.
New Array will be {1, 10, 3, 1, 3}.
